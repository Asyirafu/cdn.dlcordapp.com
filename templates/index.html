                            Welcome to dlcordapp, this small web application uses a very similar links to the cdn.discordapp.com domain used by discord to embedd content like images and gifs into the discord application. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nerdy Explanation: Discord and other chat applications that support embedding use a form of webbrowser to access content links like www.example.com/image.jpg and render the content within the chat thread. This webbroswer is usually detectable by something called a UserAgentString which you can learn more about by googling. What this application does is it monitors for requests made by the discord app useragent and returns a redirect to the cdn.discordapp.com content specified by the link to this app. However if the app doesnt detect that discord is requesting content it redirects the user to one of many different available meme links such as the all too infamous rick roll.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Why: Primarily this is an amazing way to rick roll our friends because by now people have memorized the youtube link and the many ways it can be presented, however people are much more trusting of a discord content link which displays their favorite meme. This can be made ever more effective if the discord embedding system crashes causing no images to be embedded. HAHAHAHA Funny
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also Why: To educate discord users about effective phishing methods. Yes in case you were wondering this is considered phishing except there is nothing malicious about our intent here. Phishing by definition is an attempt to get a user to click a link or access a site or download a file by making the malicious thing appear legitimate (Just like a fisherman puts a worm on a hook). Most commonly this is used in emails which can say things like "your package was delayed click (here) to find more information." or "please sign this document. Kindly, your manager" with a document attached which has malware embedded in it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Phishing just like any other attempt to spread malware on the internet is not simply confined to cheesy emails. It can come in many flavors including some which have spread through discord such as incidents like hacked accounts spreading links which hack even more accounts or the QR code login debacle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the case of this application we are sending users to youtube for a funny time but we are using the same tactics and although we have some domains attached to this application these are only a few that we decided to purchase out of the hundreds we were able to come up with within a matter of hours. The moral of the story here is not to trust every link that is sent to you even by people you think you trust. Bad websites are everywhere and consider youreself lucky this is not one of them. If you or a friend have fallen for this and will now be taking a much closer look at discord embedd links before clicking them, then congratulations we taught you how to be a little safer on the internet. Please continue to share and spread this application if not just for the memes but also for keeping the discord community at large a safer place.
